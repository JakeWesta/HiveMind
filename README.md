# HiveMind
The world's greatest website for college students needing to share and collaborate on study material!

Vision: 

HiveMind is a website where college students can collaborate and share their study materials in a safe and easy-to-use environment.

Functionality: 
- Students can join a collective class server created by a moderator.
- Students will create a custom, anonymous avatar. 
- Teachers can create sections to organize student posts.
- Students will not have access to other user's posts until they have posted their own work (to prevent cheating).
- Students may rank (upvote or downvote) other user's posts to rank the quality of work.
- If a student reaches a certain number of downvotes, your post will be removed, you lose access to other user's posts, and you may resubmit a revised version.
- Users with high amounts of upvotes will be rewarded with customizable avatar features.
- Moderators have the ability to remove posts they deem to be cheating, inappropriate, or spam. They will also have the ability to remove students from the class.
- Users can leave comments on posts to promote discussion.
