# HiveMind
HiveMind is an educational website where students can post study materials to a shared class forum and view content posted by their peers. It strives to promote a positive environment of learning, collaboration, and integrity which can help students excel in their academic careers.

After creating an account with a @ufl.edu email, users are assigned a random username to preserve anonymity. From there, they can choose what course discussion boards they'd like to join, and once they contribute study material themselves in the form of a file upload, they can view, download, and vote on others' contributions!
